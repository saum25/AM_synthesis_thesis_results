# AM_audio_thesis_results

This repository contains the results of the Activation Maximisation experiments the PhD thesis. The details about the content of each folder are mentioned below.

1. Directory - hyper_param_search_onm
   
   a) Contains the results for the experiments 1 and 2 that use the proposed FID-based evaluation metric to select the best hyper-parameter configuration.
   
   b) Experiment 1 synthesises Mel-spectrograms to minimally activate the single output layer neuron in SVDNet-R1
   
   c) Experiment 2 synthesises Mel-spectrograms to maximally activate the single output layer neuron in SVDNet-R1

2. Directory - max_min_onm
   
   a) Contains the results for the experiment 3 that uses three configurations (best and median from the experiment 1 and the best from the experiment 2) from the previous experiments to maximise and minimise the single output layer neuron in SVDNet-R1.
